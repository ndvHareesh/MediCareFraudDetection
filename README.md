# MediCareFraudDetection

** Medicare faces several challenges, one of the most significant being provider fraud. The government claims that Medicare fraud caused the total spending on the programme to grow at an exponential rate. Collaborative healthcare fraud involving peers of providers, doctors, and beneficiaries is a kind of organised crime. Thorough examination of Medicare data has uncovered numerous doctors who engage in fraudulent practises. They embrace practises that involve the use of a vague diagnosis code to approve the most expensive treatments. The insurance industry is particularly at risk because of these unethical practises. Because of this, insurance companies raised their premiums, making healthcare more expensive by the day.
