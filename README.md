** Medicare faces several challenges, one of the most significant being provider fraud. The government claims that Medicare fraud caused the programme's total spending to grow exponentially. Collaborative healthcare fraud involving peers of providers, doctors, and beneficiaries is a kind of organised crime. A thorough examination of Medicare data has uncovered numerous doctors who engage in fraudulent practices. They embrace practices that use a vague diagnosis code to approve the most expensive treatments. The insurance industry is particularly at risk because of these unethical practices. Because of this, insurance companies raised their premiums, making healthcare more expensive by the day.
